        As a craftsman, I am passionate about creating quality software and
        therefore am a strong subscriber to TDD and firmly believe in the
        emergent design of software architectures. Development is truly
        evolutionary; with its architecture reflecting less about the tools and
        more of the expression to its intent and usage.

        conferences and participate in mentoring programs, such as Pluralsight,
        one-one-one mentoring, and remote code pairing sessions.
