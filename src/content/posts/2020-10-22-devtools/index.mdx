## Overview

Today I'd like to share my developer workbench. I will cover the software I regularly use, extensions, and settings. In future blog posts, I will also demonstrate how I automated the installation and setup of these tools and provide additional details on extensions and plugins.

I have broken my software down into a couple of different lists. The "Essential" list contains software that I use regularly enough to simply always install and configure. These are the targets for my automation.

From there, I selectly will install and configure the software based on the technology stack in use. I am including some variations of them for future reference.

> Remember, my development machine is running OSX.
